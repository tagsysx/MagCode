2. **Camera Access**: Grant camera permissions when prompted
3. **Position Device**: Place smartphone near NFC reader
4. **Detect Stripes**: App automatically detects magnetic interference patterns
5. **Process Payment**: Complete transaction using native payment system

### Platform-Specific Features
- **iOS**: Apple Pay integration, Core Image processing
- **Android**: Google Pay integration, OpenCV processing

## üî¨ Technology Background

Mobile payment has achieved explosive growth in recent years due to its contactless feature, which lowers the infection risk of COVID-19. In the market, near-field communication (NFC) and barcodes have become the de facto standard technologies for mobile payment.

The NFC-based payment outperforms barcode-based payment in terms of security, usability, and convenience. It is especially more user-friendly for the amblyopia group. Unfortunately, NFC functionality is unavailable in nearly half of smartphones in the market nowadays due to the shortage of NFC modules or being disabled for security reasons.

## üí° MagCode Solution

At the heart of MagCode is the harmless magnetic interference on the CMOS image sensor of a smartphone placed nearby the NFC reader, resulting in a group of barcode-like stripes appearing on the captured images. We take advantage of these stripes to encode the data and achieve simplex communication from an NFC reader to an NFC-denied or NFC-disabled smartphone.

## üìä Technical Specifications

- **Maximum Throughput**: 2.58 kbps (58√ó better than magnetometer-based solutions)
- **Data Exchange Time**: 1.8 seconds average
- **Compatibility**: Tested across 11 smart devices
- **Protocol Stack**: Complete implementation from physical to transport layer
- **Processing Time**: ‚â§ 1.8 seconds
- **Accuracy**: ‚â• 95% stripe detection rate
- **Memory Usage**: ‚â§ 100MB
- **Battery Impact**: ‚â§ 5% per transaction

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### Project Structure
- **Platform-Specific Code**: Each platform has its own directory with native implementations
- **Shared Resources**: Algorithms, protocols, and configurations shared across platforms
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides for both platforms
- **Research Integration**: Scientific background directly connected to implementation

### Development Workflow
1. **Algorithm Design**: Create specifications in `shared/algorithms/`
2. **Protocol Definition**: Define protocols in `shared/protocols/`
3. **Platform Implementation**: Implement on iOS and Android
4. **Testing & Validation**: Ensure consistency across platforms
5. **Documentation**: Update shared documentation

### Testing Strategy
