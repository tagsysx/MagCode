## 🎯 Project Overview

MagCode is an innovative iOS application that implements cross-technology communication between NFC readers and smartphone cameras through magnetic field interference. This enables secure mobile payments without requiring NFC hardware, using only the device's camera to detect and decode magnetic stripe patterns.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Camera-based Magnetic Stripe Detection**: Uses smartphone camera to detect magnetic interference patterns
- **Real-time Image Processing**: Advanced computer vision algorithms for stripe recognition
- **Secure Payment Processing**: Apple Pay integration for seamless transactions
- **High Performance**: Target processing time ≤ 1.8 seconds with ≥ 2.58 kbps throughput
- **No Hardware Dependencies**: Works with any smartphone camera, no additional hardware required

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Core Modules

- **Camera Module**: Camera permissions, setup, and real-time capture
- **Image Processing**: Stripe detection, image enhancement, and data extraction
- **Payment Processing**: Apple Pay integration and transaction management
- **Data Models**: Comprehensive data structures and validation

### Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: SwiftUI for modern iOS interface
- **Camera**: AVFoundation for camera management
- **Image Processing**: Core Image and Vision frameworks
- **Payment**: PassKit for Apple Pay integration
- **Architecture**: MVVM with modular design

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Xcode 15.0+
- iOS 15.0+ deployment target
- Swift 5.0+
- macOS 12.0+ (for development)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MagCode.git
cd MagCode
```

2. Open the project in Xcode:
```bash
open platforms/ios/MagCode.xcodeproj
```

3. Build and run the project on your iOS device or simulator

### Development Setup
